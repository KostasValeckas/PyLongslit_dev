NEED-TO-HAVE before release

* IMPLEMENT A 2D SPEC

NICE-TO-HAVE for the future:
* dark frame support
* Fit initiation should be moved to utils - for now too much repeated code.
* for flats, make the fitted models 2d instead
* sky estimation for now assumes no tilt - combine somehow with the fitted 2D tilt solution
* Interpolation function used now is being depricated - look into swapping it out.
* Animated plots in the fitting processes
* When utils get too inflated, chop up into several models (fitting, plotting, utils) or alike.
* the filelist object in utils could use a refactor - specially in combinning with open_fits method
* it should be possible to implement automatic rotation curve detection with current tilt tracing
